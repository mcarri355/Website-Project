    <!-- Passage telling the story of  -->
     <p> Bernard's Burritos origins started in 2019, when Mr. Bernard got fired from West-Mec, a technical school, for acting as a tyrannical dictator inside his classroom. This catastrophic event for Mr. Bernard, turned out to be the biggest blessing in disguise for Bernard. In 2021 after wasting the last 2 years of his life away playing the video game "DOTA 2", Bernard decided that he should chase his dream of creating a successful burrito restaurant chain. In 2021, Mr. Bernard accomplished his dream and officially opened his first burrito restaurant named "Bernard's Burritos" in Phoenix, Arizona. Present day, Bernard's Burritos has over 15 locations spread across Arizona.</p>
